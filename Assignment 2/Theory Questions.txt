Question 3 : purpose of app.use()

app.use has several purposes: 

* app.use can allows the incorporation of middleware functions into the express app
* Facilitates serving static files (e.g., images, stylesheets) using middleware functions like express.static.
* Allows the incorporation of routers into specific paths, enabling modular route handling.
* Enables the integration of third-party middleware packages that enhance the functionality of the Express application.


Question 4

The app.method is a family of methods used for defining routes and handling http requests specific
(e.g., app.get(), app.delete(), app.post(), app.put() )


Question 5 
We can access them using the req.query object 

Question 6 

step 1 : npm install body-parser
step 2 : const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

step 3 : app.use(bodyParser.json());

step 4 : app.post('/login', (req, res) => {

  const postData = req.body;

});



Question 7

* Find method  : It returns the value of the first element that matches the criteria, 

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.find(element => element > 2);

console.log(result);  // this will return 3

This returns undefined is found nothing


* Find Index   method is similar to find(), but it returns the index of the first element that satisfies the testing function, or -1 if no such element is found.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const index = numbers.findIndex(element => element > 2);

console.log(index); // Output: 2 (index of the first element greater than 2)


* Filter  :  creates a new array with all elements that pass the provided testing function. It returns a new array containing the elements for which the testing function returns true.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const filteredNumbers = numbers.filter(element => element % 2 === 0);

console.log(filteredNumbers); // Output: [2, 4] (even numbers)
